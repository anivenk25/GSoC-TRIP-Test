# GSoC-TRIP-Test

# Driving Behavior Analysis with Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to analyze, quantify, and predict driving behavior in simulated environments. By leveraging data collected from driving simulators, the goal is to develop comprehensive solutions to address key challenges related to driver risk assessment, environment risk evaluation, attentiveness monitoring, drowsiness detection, and hazard identification.

## Problem Statements and Proposed Solutions

### 1. Quantifying Driver Risk:(trip-test-gsoc.ipynb)

**Problem Statement:** Traditional methods for quantifying driver risk lack sophistication and fail to capture nuanced patterns of risky driving behavior.

**Proposed Solution:** Utilizing advanced anomaly detection techniques, specifically Isolation Forest, to identify aberrant patterns in driving data collected from simulators. By examining features such as longitudinal and lateral acceleration, throttle, and brake usage, the algorithm can flag instances of anomalous behavior indicative of risk. Anomaly scores are computed for each data point, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the frequency and severity of risky driving incidents.

**Metrics Developed:**
- Anomaly Detection Score: Proportion of data points flagged as anomalies by the Isolation Forest algorithm.
- Average Anomaly Score: Mean anomaly score computed across all data points, providing a measure of the severity of risky driving incidents.

### 2. Evaluating Driving Environment Risk:(trip-test-gsoc.ipynb)

**Problem Statement:** Assessing the risk inherent in the simulated driving environment is challenging due to factors such as road conditions, traffic density, and environmental hazards.

**Proposed Solution:** Extending the anomaly detection framework to evaluate the risk level of the driving environment. By analyzing metrics related to roadway position, vehicle sensor data, and other contextual features, the algorithm can identify abnormal patterns suggestive of hazardous conditions. This comprehensive assessment enables proactive measures to mitigate potential risks and enhance overall road safety.

**Metrics Developed:**
- Environmental Anomaly Detection Score: Proportion of environmental conditions flagged as anomalies by the Isolation Forest algorithm.
- Average Environmental Anomaly Score: Mean anomaly score computed across all environmental conditions, providing a measure of the severity of hazardous situations.

### 3. Monitoring Driver Attentiveness:(Driver-State-Detection/driver_state_detection/mp4_impli.py)

**Problem Statement:** Traditional methods for monitoring driver attentiveness may lack precision and real-time capabilities.

**Proposed Solution:** Integrating facial landmark analysis with synchronized video data from driving simulators to track key facial features such as eye movements, blinking patterns, and head pose. Metrics such as Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), Gaze Score, and Head Pose provide quantifiable measures of attentiveness, allowing for timely intervention in the event of drowsiness or distraction.

**Metrics Developed:**
- Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR): Normalized measure of eye aperture, indicating the degree of eye openness.
- Gaze Score: L2 norm distance between the eye center and pupil position, quantifying the direction of the driver's gaze.
- Head Pose: Euler angles representing the orientation of the driver's head, indicating deviations from a neutral position.

### 4. Detecting Signs of Drowsiness:(Driver-State-Detection/driver_state_detection/mp4_impli.py)

**Problem Statement:** Identifying signs of drowsiness in drivers is essential for preventing fatigue-related accidents.

**Proposed Solution:** Leveraging facial landmark analysis to detect subtle signs of drowsiness based on changes in facial expressions and eye behavior. By continuously monitoring metrics such as Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and PERCLOS (PERcentage of CLOSure eye time), the algorithm can identify periods of prolonged eye closure indicative of drowsiness. Real-time alerts prompt the driver to take appropriate action, reducing the risk of accidents caused by fatigue.

**Metrics Developed:**
- PERCLOS (PERcentage of CLOSure eye time): Measure of the proportion of time the eyes are closed, indicating drowsiness or fatigue.

### 5. Identifying Safety Hazards in the Driving Environment:(driver_attention_seeker.ipynb)

**Problem Statement:** Manual hazard detection methods may be time-consuming and error-prone.

**Proposed Solution:** Adopting object detection techniques, specifically YOLOv9, to automatically identify and classify hazards in the driving environment. By training the model on annotated datasets, the algorithm can accurately detect a wide range of safety hazards, including vehicles, pedestrians, road signs, and obstacles. Real-time hazard detection enables proactive driver responses, enhancing overall road safety and reducing the likelihood of accidents.

**Metrics Developed:**
- Object Detection Accuracy: Measure of the algorithm's ability to accurately detect and classify safety hazards in the driving environment.

## Conclusion

By addressing these key problem statements with comprehensive solutions, this project aims to enhance our understanding of driving behavior in simulated environments and contribute to the development of safer driving practices.
